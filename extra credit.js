// Extra Credit: Company Stack Research

// There are many stack research companies!! Take a short read to hear more about the top 3 companies, I  completed a research on and even learned what “company Stack Research” even means. First of all it basically means the set of technologies used to develop an application, including programming languages, frameworks, databases, front-end and back-end tools, and APIs.” Well let’s start with my top 3 picks with the first one being facebook meta. One of the reasons I picked this one is because it uses JavaScript /HTML  and CSS in the front and back end position that is not currently available due to the high demands. Another great thing about facebook is that that provides certificate in order to advance in the company.now my second research companies would be microsoft because I have grown to hear so many thing great things about this company for example they provide shares they also give 401k matches and just help they employee grow as much as they can. Not only that but they also have an open mind to learning about your own biases and changing behaviors accordingly. One day I do wish to be a front end designer for their company. They are currently looking for this position but I am not able to apply due to the requirements. But this company also helps with the certification and they provide one free lesson per every few months.  Now my last stack research is google. Now this is a bit similar to the microsoft  because they do offer majority of the same benefit because they are a huge company and they do require you to have at least 6 years plus of experience but if you're able show them what you can bring to the table you may because to skip a few test base on a few research. I would also  love to work on their front end when I am able to apply once I have all the requirements. Now in conclusion with all of these jobs they do offer a lot of amazing benefits and once you're in with the company it would be hard to leave because of how well they take care of their employees and treat each other as family.
